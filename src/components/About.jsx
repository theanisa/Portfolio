          I'm a focused Computer Science student who approaches development with discipline and curiosity. I enjoy building clean, maintainable web applications and developing a deep foundation in full-stack principles. I prioritize structured learning, long-term growth, and consistently shipping small, valuable projects to strengthen my skills.
